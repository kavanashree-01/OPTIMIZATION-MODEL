*PROGRAM DESCRIPTION*:

This Python program takes on the task of increasing revenue from Udemy courses by carefully choosing a selection of courses that maximizes overall earnings while adhering to key constraints like total teaching hours and quality standards. It utilizes linear programming techniques through the pulp library to solve this optimization challenge. The program works with a dataset of Udemy business courses, which includes details such as pricing, subscriber counts, ratings, and teaching hours. Key steps in the process involve cleaning the data, creating features (like estimating potential revenue and teaching hours), and setting up the optimization problem along with its constraints.

Uses:
-Revenue Maximization: The program identifies the optimal combination of courses to boost total revenue, considering subscriber numbers and discounted prices.

-Constraint Handling: It skillfully manages constraints such as total teaching hours and quality benchmarks (like minimum ratings) to ensure that the chosen courses are both feasible and of high quality.

-Data Visualization: The notebook features various visualizations (like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots) to explore data distributions and relationships, aiding in informed decision-making.

-Educational Tool: It demonstrates how linear programming can be applied in business optimization, serving as a valuable resource for those interested in data science and operations research.

-Business Decision Support: The program provides actionable insights for Udemy or similar platforms, assisting them in strategizing course offerings while balancing revenue goals with available resources.

This program is built to be modular and scalable, making it adaptable for similar optimization challenges in other fields.
